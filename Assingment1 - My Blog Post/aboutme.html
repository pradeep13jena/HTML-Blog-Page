        <h1>It's me, baby!!!</h1>
        <p>
            Hello everyone! This is your host, Pradeep Jena. I'm since last two pages telling you stories about my life, i hope you've enjoyed it. 
            This page will be all about me. A few points in my life where it changed me—my behavior, my perception of life—all of these things 
            I'll write about here. Before that, let me introduce myself. My name is Pradeep Jena, born and brought up in Thane (near Mumbai) in 
            Maharastra. My parents are from Orissa; later, they moved here, and I completed all my education here itself. Here's my photo. 
            Yeah, yeah, I look good, I know. <br> <br>

            <h2>What i like to do?</h2>
            So, if you ask me, what are the specific things that you love to do? There's not only one or two things that I do; there are an ample 
            number of things that I love to do. The first thing on the list is trading. Yeah, I trade in Indian markets for futures and options, 
            to be specific. I'm not profitable <strong>YET</strong>. But surely one day <em>manifesting</em> this. Apart from this, I go to the gym. It's only been four months, 
            but I'm so in love with it. I'm so in love that I'm regretting why I didn't join earlier in my life. Gyms teach you so many things, 
            like the first thing: when you first go to a gym, no matter who you are, no matter who your ancestors are, no matter how good your genes 
            are, you won't get results in the first month. And the first month is especially where a lot of people give up. The same thing happened 
            to me; I don't know why I continued, but it was good. It really helped me. One thing people should understand is that a gym helps you 
            more mentally than physically. Just by showing up in the gym, you'll get mentally strong every day, and you'll also get disciplined.
            <br><br>
            And i also am very keen about psychology, Business and Startups. When i say psychology i don't predict what's the next word thats gonna come 
            out from people mouth. It means i love to talk to people and understand why they do whatever they do. I'll give you a hint, if you want to
            understand someone, understand their past. How they've lived what they have faced in their childhood. This peice of little things is capable
            enough to answer all the question. I also had a Startup back in 2021 at that time Startups was the hot word of the town. I also thought
            it'll be get rich quick scheme. I started with two of my friends. Rakesh and Praveen, it was named <strong>UPTO FEET</strong>. I had two
            co-founder with me and three employees. we used to earn 60000 before employee salary and everything.
            <br><br>
            <img src="Photos/Upto Feet.jpg" alt="Me and my co-founders" height="250" width="350"/> 
            <br><br> 
            Coding here it comes, the most awaited word let me be honest I don't love coding the only reason i do it is it challenge me. It really takes 
            out the best of me and it challenges me each and every moment that's why i do it. Last but not the least, the thing which is closest to 
            my heart is Roaming and Exploring. When i say roaming and exploring i don't love to visit different places in the India or somewhere else. 
            I just love to roam and explore Thane itself. What's the new shop opened recently,  what's the next construction that is happening, 
            Where's the next garden that's gonna Open. All my friends are genuinely interested in this and love to listen all the Progress Thane is going under. 
            And another reason for this is, If you remember i mentioned me, Praveen and Pankaj used to roam entire Thane. Even though they are not in 
            the city right now i am keeping this tradition alive.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong> So all in all what i do? Gosh!!! I do lot of things. Trading, Coding, Gym, Reading Books. 
            Am i good in all of those? <strong>NO.</strong> Did i stop? <strong>NO.</strong>
            Will i continue to do no matter the result? <strong>YES.</strong> Patience and Persistance are the two things that i have learned from all the
            things i do. I hope i've add some value to your life through all this. Thanks for your time, See yaa!!!
